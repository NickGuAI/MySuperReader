# Supabase Google Authentication Implementation

## Plan
1. Install Supabase dependencies
2. Create Supabase client setup
3. Update auth-service.ts to use Supabase instead of mock authentication
4. Add Google authentication functionality
5. Handle auth state changes
6. Update User interface to match Supabase user data
7. Create UI components to display user profile information
8. Fix hydration issues and navigation routing

## Tasks

- [x] Install required Supabase packages
  - [x] @supabase/supabase-js
- [x] Set up Supabase client
  - [x] Create supabase.ts service file with client configuration
- [x] Update auth-service.ts 
  - [x] Implement Google sign-in
  - [x] Add auth state listener
  - [x] Map Supabase user to app User interface
- [x] Update UI to show user profile info
  - [x] Add Google sign-in button to login page
  - [x] Update auth context to handle Google authentication
- [x] Fix post-authentication issues
  - [x] Fix hydration warnings by updating theme provider
  - [x] Fix dashboard redirect issue by redirecting to home page

## Implementation Details

1. Installed Supabase JS client library
2. Created a Supabase client configuration file at `news-summarizer/lib/external-services/supabase.ts`
3. Updated the auth service to use Supabase authentication:
   - Implemented Google OAuth sign-in
   - Added auth state change listener
   - Created a mapper function to convert Supabase user to app User type
4. Updated the Auth Context:
   - Added signInWithGoogle method
   - Made getCurrentUser async to work with Supabase
   - Added authentication state change listener
5. Added Google sign-in button to the login page with appropriate styling
6. Fixed issues that appeared after implementation:
   - Fixed React hydration warnings by adding mounting check to ThemeProvider
   - Fixed navigation issue by updating auth context to redirect to home page instead of nonexistent dashboard
   
## Debugging Notes

1. React Hydration Error: The error was related to theme inconsistency between server and client rendering. Fixed by:
   - Adding a mounted state in ThemeProvider to only show the correctly themed content after hydration is complete
   - Adding suppressHydrationWarning to the HTML element

2. Dashboard 404 Error: The auth context was redirecting to "/dashboard" but no dashboard page existed. Fixed by:
   - Updating the auth context to redirect to home page ("/") after authentication
   - Ensuring all navigation paths were consistent
