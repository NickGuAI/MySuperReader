After log in, there should be a profile page showing @userInfo.md . Update the redirect url localhost:3000/auth and create a handler for that url that handles the userinfo response, stores it, and then jump to localhost:3000.

- [ ] Log In is now replaced with profile icon
- [ ] A new profile created and user can navigate to profile page
- [ ] User can log out, which clears the previous auth information
